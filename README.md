# Work Day Schedule - Third Party API Challenge

## **Description**

What was created here was a Work Day Scheduler that you can type events into and save locally using the save button. Past events will show greyed out, while future events will be green. The present time is highlighted red and the border is thicker. This was our third Javascript challenge, but the first with using third party APIs. I found these to be a little confusing but I can see the potential that they allow for! I definitely am a lot more comfortable with them after finshing this project.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
